# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Using-Neural-Networks

Built and trained a neural network to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign using
the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset. Preprocessed data, applied
standardization, and evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and
visualization of learning curves.

Tools: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras)
